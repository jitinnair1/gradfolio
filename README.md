## Features
- Responsive
- Respects Dark Mode preference set by user
- Projects Page to showcase your work/side projects
- Easily link to your profiles on ResearchGate and ORCID

## Installation
* Click on `Use this template`
* Your new site should be ready at https://username.github.io/gradfolio/
* You can now modify the contents and personalise the template

Alternatively, you can [download the source files](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio/archive/master.zip) and make changes locally. 

To test these changes, open a terminal inside the source folder and use `jekyll serve --incremental --trace` to make it available on a local server (typically http://localhost:4000/)

The `--incremental` flag ensures that any changes you make are reflected in your browser in real time and the `--trace` option might be useful for debugging if things break while you are changing the source files.

Once you have personalised and tested the site, you can create a new repo, upload these files and host your website from the repo.
